#Merge Sort

#find middle index of array
#split array in half and assign to left and right
#recursive call to itself with the left side passed in
#recursive call to itself with the right side passed in
#merge the left and right arrays
  #until either array is empty
    #if left.first <= right.first
      # result<<left.shift
    #else result<<right.shift
  #concatenate result with array elements left over
